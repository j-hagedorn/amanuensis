## Away

Who knows how it came, the Away? 
Before the naming of things

a shard of sky, and since
whatever it touched was tinged with else.

Not only that.  Merely to hear
of the presence of absence was enough.

Soon gaps appeared in things
we thought we knew: reflections, reveries.  

In a tiny glass a room.
On a fish's head a cloud.

Found in others eyes
sun-lathed casements, ornamented skyline.

The shard fell down
or sifted up from dirt-realms.



We tattooed strangenesses into 
our flesh and called the distance longing.



In a spoonful of soup we tasted hints
of sky, or no, the absence of 
castles.

We sat on park benches, luring birds
closer to catch a scent of flight

We tried to destroy the Away
with
but obliterated it became aerosol.

It entered our clothes on clotheslines
(had there been clotheslines before?
How had we sent messages?  To whom?)

It rearranged the names in history books,
inserted episodes.
