For days compiled from decades, seconds stacked
with centuries, we pile aspiring stones
for walls, press into clay with marks
of shellwhorl and beast-teeth. Sculpt the round
insides of bowls, of days, with turn and touch, lost
strewn across a thousand noons, baked by the air.

Previous inhabitants carved lungfulls of air
from cliffs; conjured shapes from their hunger, stacked
homes along that precipice.  Their mastery is lost
with their mistakes.   ...stone
