## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
urls <- list()
urls$ladder <- "http://www.prudencetrue.com/images/TheLadderofDivineAscent.pdf"
urls$ladder_summary <- "https://www.oca.org/reflections/fr.-steven-kostoff/the-ladder-of-divine-ascent-for-us-today"
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
