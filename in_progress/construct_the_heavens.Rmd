Make some use of this.
In this grand chemical, under the shape of dark
trace the operations

of the shining fluid added by the sun upon 
bodies  to which I have 
joined to be divided into two.

(Draw upon myself without 
attempting to draw to be perceived)

Form what has been said 
from analogy for the illumination 
which remains in this paper 
of light and luminous vapours,
of these appearances I carefully

  build worlds of our own
  as far as we can (*as far from us*)

Above the rough surface as 
the square upon 
the ground the birds form 
the unevenness arising 
  out of a thousand situations - 

In possession of a list
no more than what is sufficiently evident
as the minute parts 

as I can think
    *of explaining it by mountains, by admitting large mountains*
as I have found.

Add the place.  Make it almost improbable.
Place *now* and *then*.
Place *I can only give* on *I need not fear*.

Form, confining around 
him, the whole universe
as vivid the diameters - to discover 

the places where, near 
the margin, we form 
an opening to the naked about.

Extend equally to them all as one 
full grown plant of a crookedly branching 
nebula that would point about 
a center or about 
                    all the spots

make them mere useless 
brilliant for the dark ground
about the dark part
against the moon's being

                        *as its satellite we pass*

As I decompose in the suit drawn pretty of stars
given to it I see 
by some agitation or other in a row a beautiful
                      
as difficultly resolvable
                          above construction
