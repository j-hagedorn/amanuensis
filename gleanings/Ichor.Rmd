I will love you, or rather what we make 
will be the whole I know of 'love'


the narrow bed of your body
hips riven with figures
who have borne life and lightning
tattooed tree of knowledge



Perhaps following chance is a way
of trusting in the essential goodness of the world


You make a space.  Are given
a space and live into 
it.  The bounds are given
and the ripples within it 
are made.  The boundaries shape
your voice and that voice
discovers them.

The new world is an old one re-encountered
with bodies recycled from stars.
