Behold the man, numb.  Pebbles I thumb,
bitumen and ribs.  Behold.
  
Blessed be blast and hubbub.
Blessed be notions enjambed.

Bless rabbits and burdock root
bedevilling the suburbs' drab prefab.
Bamboozle businesses and lobbyists.

Bless me also thus: 
Biology's ad-lib, limbs You ribbon with ebb of blood.
Bless us sunstabbed with each daybreak we absorb.

Blessed be lichen blossom between scree.

Bless our boxy brains 
Bless this perception ... buffering...
bored by bright objects,
bored straight through.

Bless belief, gibbous of the mind's curb.

Bless any hub.

Because it is Being we seek, we 
bow into ourselves, and then beyond.

Bless each obviously cribbed 
bequest lobbed 

Bruise my flabby blabbering.

Become, behold and hold.
